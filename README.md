Installation
------------

Installation instructions can be found in the file 
  $VIGRA_PATH/doc/vigra/Installation.html
If the documentation has not yet been generated (e.g. when you build from a development 
snapshot), you find these instructions in
  $VIGRA_PATH/docsrc/installation.dxx
or online at
  http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra/doc/vigra/Installation.html

Documentation
-------------

If you downloaded an official release, the documentation can be found in `$VIGRA_PATH/doc/vigra/`, the start file 
is `$VIGRA_PATH/doc/vigra/index.html`.

When you use the development version from github, you can generate documentation by `make doc`. Up-to-date 
online documentation for the 'master' branch is regularly pushed to http://ukoethe.github.io/vigra/doc/vigra/

Download
--------

VIGRA can be downloaded at http://hci.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/vigra/#download The official development 
repository is at https://github.com/ukoethe/vigra

What is VIGRA
-------------

VIGRA is a computer vision library that puts its main emphasis on flexible algorithms, because algorithms represent the principal know-how of this field. The library was consequently built using generic programming as introduced by Stepanov and Musser and exemplified in the C++ Standard Template Library. By writing a few adapters (image iterators and accessors) you can use VIGRA's algorithms on top of your data structures, within your environment. Alternatively, you can also use the data structures provided within VIGRA, which can be easily adapted to a wide range of applications. VIGRA's flexibility comes almost for free: Since the design uses compile-time polymorphism (templates), performance of the compiled program approaches that of a traditional, hand tuned, inflexible, solution.
