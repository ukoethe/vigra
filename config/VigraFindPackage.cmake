# - improved version of the reduced FIND_PACKAGE syntax
#
#  VIGRA_FIND_PACKAGE(package [VERSION_SPEC] [COMPONENTS component1 ... ] [NAMES name1 ...])
#
# FIND_PACKAGE is dangerous when custom search prefixes are added, because these 
# prefixes are tried for includes and libraries independently. Thus, it may happen
# that a library is found under one prefix, whereas the corresponding include is 
# found under another. Subsequent crashes of the compiled programs are likely. 
#
# VIGRA_FIND_PACKAGE improves upon this by trying custom prefixes one at a time,
# so that either both includes and libraries are found under the same prefix,
# or the search is marked as unsuccessful for this prefix.
